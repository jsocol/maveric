	<p>Thanks for choosing Maveric as your application development
		framework. Maveric is <strong>light-weight</strong> and
		<strong>flexible</strong> framework that follows the 
		<strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> paradigm.</p>

	<p>Maveric is designed to get out of your way and let you
		start writing actual application logic from the get-go.
		Because it follows the MVC paradigm, Maveric separates 
		the data, application, and presentation layers.</p>

		tries to have logical default settings for most applications.</p>
